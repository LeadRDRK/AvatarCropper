# Development
This project uses Parcel as its build tool. Simply run `npm run start` to start the development server. If this is your first time, run `npm install` first to install the dependencies.

However, since this project uses nothing but plain old web technologies, you could use anything else to serve the `src` folder.

# Build
Use `npm run build` to build the project. *This is not required as mentioned above.*
